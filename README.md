## DA - 2nd project

### Basic
- [T1.1] - simple menu interface
- [T1.2] - parse csv files
- [T1.3] - doxygen documentation

### Backtracking
- [T2.1] - develop a backtracking algorithmic approach to the TSP starting and ending on node zero (id = 0)

### Triangular Approximation
- [T2.2] - implement the approximation algorithm for TSP that relies on the triangular inequality to ensure a 2-approximation algorithm starting and ending on node zero (id = 0)

### Other Heuristics
- [T2.3] - implement another heuristic by you choice to solve the TSP starting and ending on node zero (id = 0).

__Notes:__ That algorithm should be efficient and feasible even for the large graphs.

### TSP in Real World
- [T2.4] - develop an algorithm that __always__ gives a solution to the tsp problem even in graphs that are not guaranteed to be fully connected. The starting and ending node is on user preference (id = any).
